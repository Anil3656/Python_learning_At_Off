#Heap: A tree-based data structure in which the value of a parent node is ordered in a certain way with respect to the value of its child node(s). 
# A heap can be either a min heap (the value of a parent node is less than or equal to the value of its children) or a 
# max heap (the value of a parent node is greater than or equal to the value of its children).

'''1. Insertion (Push)
Description: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.

How it works:
-> Add the element at the end of the heap (bottom-right of the tree).
-> "Bubble up" (heapify up) the element until the heap property is restored.'''

'''2. Deletion (Pop)
Description: Removes and returns the root element (min in min-heap, max in max-heap).

How it works:
-> Replace the root with the last element in the heap.
-> Remove the last element.
