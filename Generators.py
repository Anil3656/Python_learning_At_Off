#Generators in Python are a powerful tool for writing memory-efficient code, especially when working with large datasets or streams of data.
#A generator is a special type of function that returns an iterator and allows you to iterate over data lazily,
#meaning it produces values one at a time only when requested, instead of computing them all at once and storing them in memory.
#It uses the yield keyword instead of return

# How Does a Generator Work?
'''
1.When you call a generator function, it doesn't execute immediately â€” it returns a generator object.
2.Each time you call next() on the generator:

    ->The function resumes from where it last left off (after yield).

    ->Executes code until the next yield.

    ->Returns the yielded value.
3.Once all yield statements are done, it raises a 'StopIteration' exception.'''

#ðŸ†š Generator vs Normal Function:
'''
Feature	             Normal Function (return)	            Generator (yield)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returns	                A single value	                   An iterator (stream)
Execution	             All at once	                    One step at a time
Memory Usage	    High (stores all data)	              Low (yields one value)
Use case	            Simple results	                   Large data / streams'''

#Real-world Use Cases:
'''
1.Reading large files line-by-line: open(file), yield line
2.Infinite streams (e.g., prime numbers, Fibonacci)
3.Lazy evaluation for large datasets
4.Web scraping data chunk by chunk
5.Processing logs, streaming APIs'''



#Examples:
def greeting():
    print('Hi!')
    yield 1
    print('How are you?')
    yield 2
    print('Are you there?')
    yield 3
    
msg = greeting()
print(next(msg))
print(next(msg))
print(next(msg))
#print(next(msg))   #Exception will occurred After limit excide 'StopIteration'
