# Python Learning Journey by Aneelkumar M 🚀

Welcome!  
This repository is part of my hands-on journey learning Python, Django, and MySQL. I'm currently developing a **Chatbot Application** while exploring real-world tools and technologies. With just 2 months into Python, I'm diving deep, one commit at a time.

## 🛠️ What I’m Building

### 🤖 Chatbot Application
A conversational chatbot that interacts with users, responds intelligently, and stores conversation data using Django and MySQL.

**Key Features:**
- Natural response system
- Django-powered backend
- MySQL database integration
- Scalable architecture for future AI/NLP integration

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core Language)
- **Django** (Web Framework)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend Basics)
- **APIs** (for potential NLP & integrations)
- Tools like: `pip`, `virtualenv`, Git & GitHub

---

## 📚 What I’ve Learned (So Far)

### ✅ Python Fundamentals
- Data types, loops, conditionals, functions
- File handling & exception handling
- OOP, modules, list comprehensions

### ✅ Intermediate Concepts
- Django basics: models, views, templates
- MySQL connection & CRUD operations
- Building and running server-side apps
- Version control with Git

## 📈 My Learning Roadmap

I'm just getting started — here’s where I’m headed next:

- 🧠 Data Science foundations (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- 📊 Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
- 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms
- 🕸️ API consumption & integration
- 🧠 AI-powered chatbot improvements
